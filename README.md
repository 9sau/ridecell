This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Frontend Onsite 2019

We prefer the use of `yarn` with our repos.

### Getting Started

First you `yarn`
Then you `yarn start`

### Notes

- Please feel free to use any library to assit you in your work today.
  - Please try not to use libraries that are complete UI packages. 
- The server doesn't block CORS requests so you can the `fetch` api if you wish
- The API requires `'Content-Type':'application/json'` when POSTing
